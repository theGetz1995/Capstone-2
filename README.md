# Starcraft 2 Capstone
==============================

Achieving a high league in Starcraft 2 online play is hard. In fact players spend months, if not years, wobbling up and down within their league, struggling to break into the next tier. This process is hard enough that it has spawned and supports an entire online infrastructure around strategy guides, coaching, and tips & tricks all targeted at helping players “rank up”. This project aims to discern what non-strategic changes most effectively help a player increase their league tier and will use machine learning to predict players who are performing above their league status.
